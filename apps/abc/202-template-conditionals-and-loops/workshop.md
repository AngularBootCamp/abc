# Workshop

* Add the sample data from <https://api.angularbootcamp.com/videos> to
  the VideoListComponent. For now, it's okay to define this as a
  component property and assign the data directly. In future steps,
  we'll demonstrate how to retrieve this using HTTP.

* Modify the video list template to display each video's title and
  author using `@for`.
