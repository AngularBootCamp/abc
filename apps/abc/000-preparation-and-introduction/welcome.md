# Welcome to Angular Boot Camp

## Agenda

The agenda varies over time; your instructor will adjust it to match
the needs of the class and the ongoing changes in the Angular
ecosystem. Here is a rough idea of the overall agenda:

* Basics of Angular - core vocabulary to build components
* Structuring an Angular application
* Development / build tooling (Angular CLI)
* Advanced and varied features (that are okay to learn later)
* Examples, details, surrounding ecosystem

## Workshops

The instructor may have changes to the workshops, as our curriculum is
under continuous improvement and is adjusted for the needs of each
class.

## Local Development

### Install Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment used by a huge number of
tools and frameworks, including Angular. It includes the `npm` and `npx`
commands, which we'll use throughout the class.

You can download and install the current LTS (Long Term Support) version of Node.js from <http://nodejs.org>.

Linux users: we recommend installing Node using your package manager or
via a tool like [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or
[N](https://github.com/tj/n).

### Download and unzip the course materials

Visit this link to download a zip file containing the class materials. Save the file wherever you'd like to place the class materials on your system:

```
https://angularbootcamp.com/abc.zip
```

Unzip the file to create the "abc" folder, then open a terminal window
and change the current directory to the new folder. Once you're there,
run this command:

```
npm install
```

If you're unable to perform this install on your machine, ask the
instructor for assistance.

### Serve the example applications

To run each example, enter a command like this within the "abc" directory:

```
npm start abc-100
```

Change "100" to the number of the example you want to run. Press Control-C when you want to stop one example and start another.
