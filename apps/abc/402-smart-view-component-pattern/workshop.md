Your application probably contains several components which mix
backend interface functionality with display functionality. Split at
least two of those in to pairs of components: Smart and Presentation.

It is usually best to name your view/presentation components with the
word View on the end, as it is shorter than Presentation.

If the set of data fields you're displaying in your components is too
small to make the value of this pattern obvious, simply edit your JSON
data to add a few more fields about each video.
