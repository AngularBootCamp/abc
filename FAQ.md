# Frequently asked questions... and answers

## Is this the entire Angular Boot Camp curriculum?

This is the bulk of the example code we use in teaching Angular Boot
Camp, but there are some extra parts that we distribute as needed in
class. Reading through these is not a substitute for attending class,
much of the "magic" is from the instruction and workshop assistance.

## Why has Oasis Digital published this material?

* We've been making this material available to students after class
  "forever" - and this is a new and easier way to do so.
* Some potential students have asked the preview some of our
  materials; this is a great way to make it available for that.
* Posting them here makes it exceptionally easy to load them up in
  StackBlitz and other tools.
* While in the early days of Angular, our examples were a unique
  asset, nowadays the web is densely populated with Angular
  information. Yet it is of variable quality, and especially of
  variable timeliness. By publishing our material, we offer a
  (hopefully) canonical, reliable source of up-to-date examples of
  numerous Angular features.

## Is this Open Source?

Yes! The materials here are released under the Apache 2 license, which
allows reuse with attribution.

## Can I use this to teach my own "Angular Boot Camp"?

Sorry, we have trademarked that name of our class. Please choose
another name for yours.

## Will these examples be updated?

We publish the examples here via an automatic mechanism, so as we
continue to update how we teach Angular Boot Camp, these examples
will be updated also.
