# Frequently asked questions... and answers

## Is this the entire Angular Boot Camp curriculum?

This is the bulk of the example code we use in teaching Angular Boot
Camp, but there are extra parts that we distribute as needed in
class. Reading through these files is not a substitute for attending class;
much of the "magic" is from the instruction and workshop assistance.

## Why has Oasis Digital published this material?

* We’ve been making this material available to students after class
  "forever" -- and this is a new and easier way to do so.
* Some potential students have asked to preview some of our
  materials, and this is a great way to make them available.
* Posting them here makes it exceptionally easy to load them up in
  [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/) and other tools.
* In the early days of Angular, our examples were a unique
  asset, but nowadays the Web is densely populated with
  information about Angular. Yet it varies wildly in quality, and
  especially in timeliness. By publishing our material, we offer a
  (hopefully) canonical, reliable source of always up-to-date examples of
  numerous Angular features.

## Is this Open Source?

## Can I use this to teach my own "Angular Boot Camp"?

That trademark is owned by Oasis Digital. Please choose
another name for your classes.

## Will these examples be updated?

We publish the examples here via an automated mechanism. As we
continue to update how we teach Angular Boot Camp, these examples will
automatically get updated.

## How can I help?

Link, tweet, star repositories, and encourage your friends and coworkers
to attend [Angular Boot Camp](https://angularbootcamp.com/)!
