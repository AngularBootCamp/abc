Welcome to the Angular Boot Camp Curriculum. This repository contains
much of the example code we use in teaching [Angular Boot
Camp](https://angularbootcamp.com/), available here to use in class, or
for developers everywhere to refer to for (hopefully) high-quality
examples of specific Angular topics.

Many examples have explanations inline, but of course we provide
extensive explanation during Angular Boot Camp.

## Command Line Scripts Usage

To figure out the name to use in the command line snippets below, just
copy everything before the first `-` of the example app's directory. For
example: `abc-101-data-binding` would be `abc-101`.

### Running an example

```bash
npm start abc-101
```

### Running the unit tests for an example

```bash
npm run test abc-722
```

### Building an example

```bash
npm run build rxjs-600
```
