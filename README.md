# Angular Boot Camp Curriculum - DRAFT

Welcome to the Angular Boot Camp Curriculum. This repository
contains over half of the example code we use in teaching
[Angular Boot Camp](https://angularbootcamp.com/),
available here to use in class, or for the web at large to refer to as
(hopefully) high quality examples of specific Angular topics.

Initially these examples contain very little explanation; we provide
the explanation during the Angular Boot Class. In the future we hope
to add more explanation in line here, but this material is
fundamentally about supporting our class effort.

## Topic List
